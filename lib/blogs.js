    title: "Tips to Avoid Coding Bootcamp Burnout",
    author: "Bethanny Parker",
    datePosted: "August 26, 2021",
    content:
      "Coding bootcamp burnout can happen to anyone, even the most resilient of students. The best way to avoid burning out during a bootcamp is to prepare ahead of time. Getting a good night's sleep every night can reduce stress and burnout. Because students must learn so many new things in such a short amount of time, coding bootcamps can be very challenging. Students encounter new material every day, and there is almost always homework, which may keep them up late into the night. Additionally, most bootcamps maintain a rigorous schedule that makes it extremely difficult to catch up if you fall behind. This stressful environment can lead some students to develop mental exhaustion, also known as burnout. You may think that as a strong student this won't apply to you. But coding bootcamp burnout can happen to anyone.",

      "As of now, I believe about half of my classmates have received job offers and the other half are still working on getting their skills up to par. That's really the beauty of coding dojo. If you work a little slower than the pace of the class or if concepts take a little longer, you are more than welcome to stick around and make sure you are ready to enter the workforce.",

    title: "6 ways I manage my mental health on a coding boot-camp",
    author: "Megan Hayes",
    datePosted: "Mar 17, 2020",
    content:
      "A boot-camp of any kind is by its nature, very demanding of your energy, time and mental focus. Whilst managing your mental health can be equally, and arguably more demanding of your energy, time and mental focus. This posed a dilemma; how could I continue to manage my mental health and divert the required amount of time and energy to the course? One thing I was certain of was that I was not going to let my mental health stop me from fulfilling my potential. Likewise, I wasnâ€™t going to roll the dice with my mental health. I needed to find a way to tailor the Makers course to my needs. This is how I did it.",
